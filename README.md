# Slower News

### WTF is this?

This is, somehow, a slowly updated news-aggregator with relevant trends, micro-trends and edge cases for borderline nerds, that don't want to miss out, neither spend a shit-ton of time distilling trivia.
This project appeared while «scratching my own itch» - an information flood is drowning our times - and before becoming a website, it lived as a markdown file.

### How do you curate articles?

Articles are hand selected. Everything that calls my attention and passes the «trivia filter» will be added to Slower News. It's certainly affected by my biases <a href="https://github.com/slownews/wisdom-tldr-guide/blob/master/FAQ%20%26%20CHANGELOG.md#what-are-your-main-biases">(I'm aware of these)</a> and most articles were on Hacker News.

### How often is Slower News updated?

Only when relevant. Visit every month and «you're good to go». New articles are easy to spot.

### Can I contribute?

Open an issue or pull request this repository with relevant links, corrections or suggestions. Nevertheless, I'm the BDFL of the main page.

### Feeling grateful?

Shop through my <a href="https://amzn.to/2xAL8zb">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/2xvNQ9k">Amazon.ca</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/2JcTuUC">Amazon.uk</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/2YtjT5A">Amazon.de</a> affiliate links. You pay exactly the same and it keeps my motivation high. I don't want to publish intrusive ads neither data farm with yet another stupid login.

### Colophon

Hand coded SPA - with no JS - and statically hosted at Netlify from a Github repository. Tufte CSS (adapted). No images, no tracking (GDPR friendly analytics with Goatcounter) and no bloat. Ok, I use non-standard fonts but web design is mostly typography.
