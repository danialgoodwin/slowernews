# Slower News - FAQ

### WTF is this?

This is, somehow, a slowly updated news-aggregator with relevant trends, micro-trends and edge cases for borderline nerds, that don't want to miss out, nor spend a shit-ton of time distilling trivia.
This project appeared while «scratching my own itch» - an information flood is drowning our times - and before becoming a website, it lived as a markdown file.

In sum, it started as something I wanted to read and couldn't find elsewhere. Later I started to see it as a way of using my research/procrastination positively.

### How do you curate articles?

Articles are hand selected. Everything that calls my attention and passes the «trivia filter» will be added to Slower News. It's certainly affected by my biases (I'm aware of these<sup id="refnote1"> [1](#footnote1)</sup>) and most articles were on Hacker News.

### How often is Slower News updated?

Only when relevant. Visit every month and «you're good to go». New articles are easy to spot.

### Can I contribute?

Open an issue or pull request this repository with relevant links, corrections or suggestions. I plan to curate only two pages ([Main](https://www.slowernews.com/) and one about [Portugal](https://www.slowernews.com/portugal)) but I accept pull requests creating/updating more - if you can curate them and will handle the burden of using HTML. For now this is my filter to accept them.

#### So What pages can I create?

Ultimately, it's up to you.

Specific Slower News that I would like to read but I don't have the time (probably nor the knowledge) to curate: on Javascript, on Clojure, on Front-end, on Architecture, on Space exploration ...

### Colophon

Hand coded SPA - with no JS - and statically hosted at Netlify from a Github repository. Tufte CSS (adapted). No images, no tracking (GDPR friendly analytics with Goatcounter) and no bloat. Ok, I use non-standard fonts but web design is mostly typography.
